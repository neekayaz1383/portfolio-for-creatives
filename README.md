## 💡 Easy Beginner Edits: No Coding Skills Needed

These are great first steps to customize your portfolio visually without writing any real code.

1. **Change the hero text in `index.html`**  
   Open `index.html` and look near the top. Replace the big heading with your own intro.  
   _Example: “Welcome to My Portfolio” or “Hi, I’m [Your Name], a Graphic Designer!”_

2. **Edit the colours in `style.css`**  
   Scroll through `style.css` and look for these lines:  
   `--color-text-primary: #222;`  
   `--color-accent-primary: #5200ff;`  
   Change the hex codes to your preferred color palette.

3. **Change the fonts**  
   Still in `style.css`, update the `@import` URL at the top to load a different Google Font.  
   Then change these variables:  
   `--font-family-body`  
   `--font-family-heading`  
   `--font-family-project-title`

4. **Update your social media links**  
   Open `index.html` and scroll to the footer. Look for links like:  
   `<a href="#">Insta</a>`  
   `<a href="#">LinkedIn</a>`  
   `<a href="#">Behance</a>`  
   Replace each `#` with your real profile link.

5. **Write your bio in the footer or about page**  
   It's trendy now to keep your footer short—something like _“Let’s connect.”_  
   👉 For a longer bio, open `about.html` and replace the demo text with your story.

6. **Edit your project pages**  
   Open `project-1.html`, `project-2.html`, or `project-3.html`.  
   Replace the placeholder title and description with your actual project details.

After making these changes, visit your live site to see the changes in action!

## 🧙‍♂️ Advanced Customization

For those who want to go beyond the basics, here are some advanced customizations. A solid understanding of HTML and CSS is required for these changes. Knowledge of JavaScript will also help with interactive elements. If you're new to coding, check out this [HTML & CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css) to get started!

## 🎨 CSS Structure

This project’s CSS is designed to be easy to read, edit, and customize—even if you’re just getting started with code.

**Main Stylesheet: `style.css`**  
The core styles live in style.css, with design tokens (like color and typography) stored as CSS variables at the top. This makes it quick and easy to adjust the entire theme by editing just a few values—perfect for learning how global styles work.

**Responsive Design and Mobile-First Approach** The layout follows a mobile-first philosophy. It starts with styles optimized for small screens and uses media queries to adjust the design for larger devices (tablets, desktops). This approach ensures a smooth, responsive experience across all screen sizes.

**CSS Comments and Readability** Each section in the style.css file is clearly divided with comments and ASCII headers, making it easy to navigate and understand. These sections are designed to be beginner-friendly, and each part is divided with clear comments to help you understand what’s happening. You'll find sections for various styles like typography, layout components, and responsive breakpoints. Each section is designed to be beginner-friendly, so even if you’re new to CSS, you’ll have a clear understanding of how the styles are structured.

**🧑‍🎨 Custom CSS Comments for Beginners** We’ve included helpful CSS comments throughout the style.css file to guide you step-by-step, especially if you're new to coding. These comments explain what each section of code does, making it easier to understand and customize the template. These comments will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by the code, while also teaching you essential CSS concepts.

**Custom Fonts & Optional Effects**  
Google Fonts are preloaded and easy to swap. You’ll also find optional CSS imports for visual effects like gradients, flying elements, and scroll-to-top buttons. You can delete any you don’t need.

**🎨 Custom Styles for Key Design Elements** This template includes custom CSS classes for several key design elements to help you style and highlight important sections of your portfolio: Hero Section, Project Titles and Descriptions, Navigation Links, and more. These custom styles make it simple to bring your unique personality into the design and tailor it to your specific needs.

**🎯 Utility Classes for Quick Styling** These utility classes are perfect for making quick, reusable adjustments: Border-radius for rounded corners on images and cards. Text centering for headings or buttons. Spacing utilities: Controls for margin and padding for spacing elements quickly and consistently.

**Clearly Marked Sections**  
To help you navigate the stylesheet, each part is divided with comments and ASCII headers. Sections include:

1. Base Styles
2. Typography
3. Layout Components
4. Page Templates
5. Responsive Breakpoints

## 🖼️ Assets and Image Guidelines

Keep your image files organized within the assets folder. You can create subfolders for each project to keep things tidy. This makes it easier to update or add new images as you go.

**🧹 Resize & Optimize Images**

When adding images to your portfolio, it’s important to prioritize performance. Large image files can significantly slow down your site, negatively affecting the user experience. Resize your images to fit the layout without making them unnecessarily large. For project images, use JPG format, and aim for a width of 1500px for portrait images and 1900px for landscape images. Each image should ideally be under 750 KB in file size to ensure your site loads quickly and smoothly.

To further optimize performance, compress your images to reduce file size without losing quality. This will help maintain the visual appeal of your portfolio while keeping it lightweight. Avoid using oversized images, as they can cause your site to load slowly and may even lead to technical issues with platforms like GitHub. By optimizing your images properly, you’ll improve your site's speed and user experience.

For videos, it's best to host them on third-party services like Vimeo or YouTube and embed them into your HTML code. This prevents heavy video files from slowing down your site. As for animated GIFs, keep them under 20 frames; longer GIFs are essentially videos and can increase file sizes, which can impact your site's performance. Optimizing both images and media will help ensure that your portfolio remains fast and efficient.
